# PreECESCON-Smart-House
PreECESCON is a hackathon event, part of the Studentâ€™s Conference of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECESCON) 
that take place in various cities of Greece, since 2007. This year's concept was smart houses, meaning the various ways 
to make our daily lives more comfortable. We created a simulation of a smart home system with the main purpose of 
energy saving. Specifically, our project contains sensors in order to detect humidity and temperature, provides user 
with an easy to use website where he/she can check and change the state of the devices (e.g. close the tv or open the window) 
and keep him updated about what happens in the house (which devices are on). We came in sixth.
